### A medical center management app

The application connects both the doctor and the patient through an appointment that the patient reserves for us with a specific doctor to conduct a preview
At first, the patient's information is recorded and a medical record is created for him within the medical center
The doctor can organize his appointments through the application by scheduling and inquiring about appointments

It has used  Retrofit for REST API methods  and Room Data for caching methods
